# Glyph Recognition Training System - Status Report
**Last Updated:** 2025-10
**Project:** Large-scale glyph embedding and classification using LeViT
**Status:** ⚠️ Baseline functional, critical data pipeline caveat resolved (image/label misalignment); ready to proceed with corrected pipeline

---

## 📊 Project Overview

### Goal
Train a deep learning model to:
1. **Classify** 1,588 unique glyphs (codepoint + form combinations)
2. **Embed** glyphs into 128-D space for visual similarity retrieval
3. Achieve 5-10% top-1 accuracy and 50-70% top-10 retrieval

### Architecture
- **Backbone:** LeViT_128S (7.5M parameters)
- **Input (current options):**
  - Legacy: 128×128 (8×8 token grid)
  - Improved: 224×224 (14×14 token grid) for better fine detail retention
- **Dual-head design:**
  - Classification head: 384→(N_classes) (fine-grained identity)
  - Embedding head: 384→256→128→L2norm (visual similarity)
- **Planned variants:** Patch-size 8 at 128 resolution (higher token density) and larger LeViT configs after baseline stabilization

### Dataset
- **Total glyphs:** 531,398 (full reservoir)
- **Current working subsets:** 100k (exploration), ~19k (filtered), 17k (post exclusion)
- **Original unique labels:** 1,588 (codepoint_form, e.g., "65227_init")
- **After min-label-count>=5 & shaped exclusion:** dynamic (e.g. 709–1057 classes in recent runs)
- **Unique joining groups:** 249 (visual structure, e.g., "BEH", "HAH")
- **Unique char classes:** 11 (semantic type, e.g., "latin", "diacritic")
- **Problematic label form (now excluded or to be normalized):** `U+XXXX_form_shaped`
- **Storage:** SQLite database (`dataset/glyphs.db`)

## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Model Components

```
Input: (B, 1, 128, 128) grayscale images
  ↓
Grayscale → RGB replication (1→3 channels)
  ↓
LeViT_128S Backbone:
  - Hybrid CNN-Transformer
  - b16 stem: 128→8 resolution (4× downsampling)
  - 3 stages: [128, 256, 384] channels
  - Attention + MLP blocks
  ↓
Global pooling: (B, 384) features
  ↓
┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ Classification Head  │ Embedding Head          │
│ (384 → 1,588)        │ (384→256→128→L2norm)    │
│ Linear (no BN)       │ 2-layer MLP + normalize │
└──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Modifications from Upstream LeViT

1. **Resolution:** 128×128 (vs 224×224 upstream)
   - Initial tokens: 8×8 = 64 (vs 14×14 = 196)
   - Lower capacity but sufficient for glyphs

2. **Classifier head:** Plain Linear (removed BatchNorm)
   - BatchNorm unstable with 1,588 classes and batch size 1024
   - Replaced `BN_Linear(384, 1588)` with `Linear(384, 1588)`

3. **Grayscale input:** Replicate to 3 channels
   - Avoids modifying pretrained conv weights

4. **No pretrained weights:** Training from scratch
   - Resolution mismatch would require attention bias remapping

## 🔧 Training Configuration

### Loss Functions

**1. Classification Loss (Cross-Entropy)**
```python
ce_loss = CrossEntropyLoss(logits, labels)
# Uses fine-grained labels (1,588 classes)
# Purpose: Learn exact glyph identity
```

**2. Contrastive Loss (Supervised InfoNCE)** ⭐ KEY INNOVATION
```python
emb_loss = supervised_contrastive_loss(embeddings, contrastive_groups)
# Uses HYBRID grouping (260 groups)
# Purpose: Learn visual similarity
```

### Hybrid Contrastive Grouping Strategy

**Problem:** Using `joining_group` only created a 66k "NO_JOIN" mixed bag containing:
- Latin letters, diacritics, punctuation, symbols, digits (all different!)

**Solution:** Hybrid grouping
```python
if joining_group != "NO_JOIN":
    contrastive_group = joining_group  # Arabic: BEH, HAH, YEH, etc.
else:
    contrastive_group = "cc_" + char_class  # NO_JOIN: cc_latin, cc_diacritic, etc.
```

**Result:**
- Arabic letters: 248 groups by visual structure (BEH, HAH, etc.)
- Latin letters: 1 group (cc_latin)
- Diacritics: 1 group (cc_diacritic)
- Punctuation: 1 group (cc_punctuation)
- Etc.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Latin 'A' groups with Latin 'B' (not with diacritics!)
- ✅ Semantically correct clustering
- ✅ Expected +5-10% improvement in retrieval accuracy

### Combined Loss
```python
total_loss = ce_loss + emb_loss_weight * emb_loss
# Default: emb_loss_weight = 0.25
```

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Critical Bug #1: No Embedding Loss (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Embedding head had no direct supervision
- Only learned through shared backbone gradients from classifier
- Embeddings weren't discriminative

**Fix:** Added `supervised_contrastive_loss()`
- InfoNCE-style contrastive learning
- Pulls same-group embeddings closer, pushes different-group farther

### Critical Bug #2: Deterministic Augmentation (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** `seed = cfg.seed + glyph_id` → same augmentation every epoch
**Fix:** `seed = cfg.seed + glyph_id + epoch * 1M + call_counter`
- Now varies across epochs

### Critical Bug #3: BatchNorm Classifier Instability (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** `BN_Linear` unstable with 1,588 classes and small batch sizes
**Fix:** Replaced with plain `Linear(384, 1588)`

### Critical Bug #4: Gradient Flow (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Features stored AFTER classifier consumption
**Fix:** Store features BEFORE, so both heads share same tensor reference

### Critical Bug #5: Image / Label Misalignment in Pre-Raster Cache (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Post-filtering (excluding `_shaped`, min-label-count pruning) occurred *after* preraster tensor / memmap build. Dataset fast-path indexed preraster tensor by new filtered row order → images no longer matched labels (training stuck near random).
**Symptoms:** Val loss hovered at random baseline (≈ ln(#classes)), val acc ~0.1–0.3%, retrieval stable but classification stagnant across many hyperparameter changes.
**Fix:** Disable preraster reuse during diagnosis; confirmed learning recovers (val CE ↓ from 6.54 → 5.52, top-1 ↑ to 8.1%). Action: Move all filtering *before* preraster build; add guard to rebuild if counts mismatch.

## 🧪 Test Results

### 10k Sample Test (CPU, No Embedding Loss) [Historical]
```
Dataset: 10k samples, 793 classes, 12 samples/class
Result: Val acc 0.0-0.8% (near random)
Issue: Severe underfitting due to insufficient data
```

### 16k Sample Test (CPU, Emb Loss Enabled)
```
Dataset: 16k samples, 920 classes, 15 samples/class
Train loss: 8.34 → 5.94 (dropping ✅)
Val loss: 6.6 → 8.4 (diverging ❌)
Val acc: 0.0-0.4% (overfitting)
Emb loss: 5.76 → 5.20 (barely improving)

Conclusion: Need more data! 15 samples/class insufficient
```

### Updated Findings
**Earlier belief:** Pure data insufficiency.
**Refined understanding:** Two compounding factors:
1. Data sparsity in long tail (≤5 samples/class) *and*
2. A silent image/label misalignment caused by post-preraster filtering.

**After fix (no preraster / filter-first logic):**
- 224×224, 709 classes (min-count≥5, shaped excluded)
- Val CE: 6.54 → 5.52 (epoch 10)
- Val Top-1: 0.36% → 8.1%
- Retrieval metrics improving gradually (effect size ~0.49)

This confirms architecture and optimization are fundamentally sound once supervision integrity is restored.

### Key Insights (Revised)

### Architecture Validation
✅ LeViT_128S backbone works correctly  
✅ Dual-head design (classifier + embedding) functional  
✅ Gradient flow verified (both heads receive gradients)  
✅ 224×224 improves fine-detail separability over 128×128  
✅ All tensor dimensions consistent  
⚠️ Pre-raster misuse can silently poison supervision (now addressed)  
⚠️ Fine-grained forms may still be visually ambiguous at 16‑px patches → consider patch-size 8 or hierarchical labels  

### Training Dynamics
✅ CE loss decreases properly (post-fix)  
✅ Embedding loss meaningful when alignment correct  
✅ Retrieval metrics track embedding quality  
⚠️ Long-tail labels (<5 samples) harm stability → prune or aggregate  
⚠️ Contrastive grouping still coarse for some NO_JOIN categories → may require finer taxonomy or caps  
⚠️ Augmentation can invert train/val CE order (train harder than val)  

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum viable:** 100 samples/class → 2-4% accuracy
- **Good baseline:** 300+ samples/class → 5-10% accuracy
- **Strong performance:** 500+ samples/class → 10-15% accuracy

### Hybrid Grouping Impact
- Original: 249 groups, but NO_JOIN (66k glyphs) was mixed bag
- Hybrid: 260 groups, semantically correct
- Expected improvement: +5-10% retrieval accuracy
- Most important for non-Arabic glyphs (Latin, diacritics, etc.)

## 📋 Next Tasks

### Immediate (Reprioritized)
1. ✅ Verify learning without preraster (DONE)  
2. ⏳ Implement filter-first preraster build + mismatch guard  
3. 🔄 Re-run 100k subset @224 with new clean preraster (compare speed & metrics)  
4. 🎯 Add train accuracy & (optionally) label smoothing for stability  
5. 🧪 Contrastive schedule: start weight 0.0 → ramp to 0.02 after epoch 5  
6. 📊 Add top-5 / top-10 classification metrics logging  
7. 🔍 Collision audit: perceptual hash clusters for visually indistinguishable labels  
8. 🏗️ Plan hierarchical (coarse→fine) pretraining experiment  

### Full Run (After Above)
- 531k @224 or 192 (resource trade-off)
- Batch: effective 1024–2048 via accumulation
- Contrastive cap (e.g. 512) to control O(B²) memory

### After Baseline Works
4. **Hyperparameter tuning**
   - Try `--emb-loss-weight 0.15, 0.2, 0.3`
   - Try `--batch-size 2048` (more positive pairs)
   - Try `--lr-backbone 0.002, --lr-head 0.004`

5. **Architecture enhancements**
   - Enable ArcFace margin loss: `--arcface-margin 0.12`
   - Try larger model: LeViT_256 (if memory allows)
   - Try higher resolution: 224×224 (slower but more capacity)

6. **Evaluation & analysis**
   - Run retrieval evaluation on test set
   - Visualize embedding space (t-SNE/UMAP)
   - Analyze failure cases (which classes confuse most)

### Future Improvements (Expanded)
7. Test-time augmentation (+0.5–1% accuracy)  
8. Label smoothing (+0.5–1% accuracy)  
9. Model ensemble (3–5 models, +1–2% accuracy)  
10. Curriculum / hierarchical labeling (coarse codepoint → fine form)  
11. Patch-size 8 variant at 128 (increase tokens without full 224 cost)  
12. Gradient checkpointing to enable larger batches at higher resolutions  
13. Adaptive contrastive temperature (monitor positive density)  
14. Semi-supervised augmentation (pseudo-labeling visually clustered unlabeled shapes if added later)

## 📝 Important Notes

### Recent Training Pipeline Enhancements (Embedding Ramp & Adaptive Scheduling)
- Embedding Ramp: dynamic weight now specified via `--emb-target-weight`, `--emb-start-epoch`, `--emb-ramp-epochs`. Effective weight logged each epoch as `(eff_emb_w=...)`. This replaces the formerly static `--emb-loss-weight` usage during early epochs.
- Grouping Mode & Switch: initial supervised contrastive grouping can be forced to fine-grained `label` (`--contrastive-grouping label`) and later auto-switch to `hybrid` (joining_group + char_class) at `--grouping-switch-epoch N` to first separate exact classes, then encourage broader semantic clustering for retrieval.
- Adaptive Embedding Weight Decay: optional (`--adaptive-emb-patience`, `--adaptive-emb-decay`, `--adaptive-emb-min-weight`) monitors validation accuracy after ramp completion; if no improvement for a patience window, the target embedding weight decays (never below the configured floor). Helps prevent contrastive dominance in very long (200 epoch) full runs.
- Head LR Bump: one-time multiplicative bump of classification head learning rate at `--head-lr-bump-epoch` with factor `--head-lr-bump-factor` to re-energize class separation after ramp / early plateau.
- Backbone Freeze Warmup: `--freeze-backbone-epochs K` freezes backbone *excluding* `backbone.head` and `embed_head` so early ramped embedding / head layers stabilize without large backbone drift.
- Debug Noise Removed: verbose per-batch debug prints (`[DEBUG] contrastive positives ...`, `[DEBUG] first batch shape=...`) removed for cleaner long-run logs; integrity & ramp info retained.
- Banner Accuracy: startup banner now shows ramp parameters, grouping mode, planned grouping switch, adaptive decay settings, and head LR bump schedule (legacy "Embedding loss weight: 0.3" line removed to avoid confusion).
- Scaling Guidance (531k / 200 epochs): 
  * Suggested initial config: freeze backbone first 4–6 epochs, ramp embedding over ~10–12 epochs (≈5% of total), target weight 0.04–0.06, schedule cosine LR with warmup_frac 0.05–0.08. 
  * Enable adaptive decay with patience ≈ 12–16 epochs post-ramp; decay factor 0.85–0.9; min weight 0.015–0.02.
  * Optional head LR bump around epoch ~ (ramp_end + patience/2) if val accuracy plateaus.
- Rationale: These adjustments corrected earlier early-epoch contrastive dominance (which slowed classification lift) and improved stability when moving from 20k slice (367 classes, best top-1 ≈38%) to 100k slice (996 classes, top-1 ≈21.7% under ramped label-grouping). Expect further gains with adaptive decay and grouping switch on full 531k set.


### Why Previous Runs Failed
1. **10k-16k samples insufficient** for 800-900 classes
2. Only ~15 samples per class → severe overfitting
3. Model has 7.5M parameters but only 15k training samples
4. Ratio: 500 parameters per sample (way too high!)

### Why Full Run Should Work
1. **531k samples, 1,588 classes** → 335 samples/class ✅
2. Ratio: 14 parameters per sample (much better!)
3. All architectural bugs fixed
4. Hybrid contrastive grouping prevents bad clustering
5. GPU speeds up training 10-30×

### Pre-rasterization Strategy
- **First run:** Pre-rasterize 531k images (~10-15 min, one-time)
- **Subsequent runs:** Reuse memmap file (instant)
- **Storage:** ~260 MB for uint8 memmap
- **Speed:** Fast-path lookup, no repeated rasterization

### Checkpointing Strategy
- Save `best.pt` (highest val accuracy)
- Save `last.pt` (latest epoch)
- Save `epoch_N.pt` (every epoch, for resume)
- Save `optimizer_state.pt` (for exact resume)
- Can resume training: `--resume raster/checkpoints/last.pt`
